 ~ Gameplay:
    > The ball will bounce back and forth across the screen, being hit by the paddles.
    > If the ball gets past a paddle, the other player gets a point.
 ~ Beginning Conditions:
    > The ball is going to start in the center of the screen
    > The two paddles start in the middle of the screen, one on the very left and the other on the very right.
    > The ball will then move toward the left paddle at an angle (speedY = random number)
    > Each player will also start with 0 points.
 ~ Endgame:
    > The game ends when one player reaches 10 points
    > Then the screen will read either "P1 WINS!" or "P2 WINS!"
 ~ If Statements:
    > If P1 has 10 points, P1 wins
    > If P2 has 10 points, P2 wins
    > If the ball touches the top or bottom of the screen, reverse the vertical speed
