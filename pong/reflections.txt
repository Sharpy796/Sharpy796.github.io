 ~ The ball will bounce back and forth across the screen, being hit by the paddles. If the ball gets past a paddle, the other player gets a point.
 ~ The ball is going to start in the center of the screen, with the two paddles in the middle of the screen, on on the very left and the other on the very right. The ball will then move toward the left paddle. Each player will also start with 0 points.
 ~ The game ends when one player reaches 10 points. Then the screen will read either "P1 WINS!" or "P2 WINS!"
 ~ If Statements:
    > If P1 has 10 points, P1 wins
    > If P2 has 10 points, P2 wins
    > If the ball touches the top or bottom of the screen, reverse the vertical speed
    > If the ball touches the left of the screen, give P2 a point
    > If the ball touches the right of the screen, give P1 a point
    > If the ball touches a paddle, reverse the horizontal speed
